**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Brandon D. Milligan

Time spent: 16 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Player receives an alert indicating how many strikes they have after they make a mistake.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
In creating this submission, a challenge was creating video walkthroughs that reflected ALL implemented features through a gif. Due to the restricted functionality that gifs have when exemplifying details, it wasn't easy to find a way to demonstrate each component. The specific features that presented a challenge were showing that the buttons made sounds when clicked on and that buttons used pitches other than the ones in the tutorial. Upon reading the instructions for Task 2, the text made it clear to "make sure ALL implemented features have been reflected on your gif." This obligation stumbled as it resulted in me spending hours on finding the right software to record my video walkthroughs. Upon doing some research, I realized that gifs are simple image formats that do not support sound. Now, the question was, how am I going to show that my buttons make a sound when clicked and that I used frequencies of my choosing for them. I decided that the only way to stick to the instructions was to record a gif of the HTML, Javascript, and CSS code that allowed the buttons and frequencies to do so. This gif was also submitted and shown on this README.md file for my submission. While this problem stumbled me at first, I used my diligence to stay focused and solve the issue at hand. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
As a child, I was an avid gamer and always enjoyed spending my free time playing online games such as Wizard101, ToonTown, and hundreds of different games on websites like Miniclip and CrazyGames. The project at hand was the first video game that I have ever programmed, and it allowed me to gain a better understanding of what goes into the creation of one. I also learned about three coding languages and their implications, formerly foreign to me: HTML, Javascript, and CSS. While my knowledge of web development has expanded, it has grown in correlation with my curiosity. After completing my submission, a couple of questions about web development have arisen. The first question that comes to mind is, if I wanted to create a game and upload it to a website with a custom URL instead of glitch.com, how would I do so? I always dreamed of being the creator of the games instead of the consumer and feel like the possibilities would be endless. This project has not only inspired me to expand my knowledge of web development but started my journey into game development. Another question has arisen: What goes into developing virtual and augmented reality video games. I now have a basic sense of how a low-level web is produced, but my innovative mindset has made me wonder what separates what I have just done and the new groundbreaking and trending technologies of today. In expanding my knowledge of web development, I believe that I have started my journey and will be able to one day work on these technologies and, as a result, change the world. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would optimize them and do as much as possible. First, I would ensure that I had completed all of the optional features that I did not complete in submitting my project. I would make animals the theme of the button change appearance, using an animal of each button's color for each of the controls. For example, the light green button would change into a green tree frog, and the pale yellow button would change into a yellow duckling when clicked. In addition, I would switch the generic sounds of clicking the buttons into the sounds that the animals make: a croak for the frog and a quack for the duckling. This change would make the game more aesthetic and creative. Still, it would allow the game to target a specific audience: elementary students learning to match animals with their sounds and improve their cognitive skills. I am a perfectionist, so once I did the necessary research, I would also implement a timer into the game, making it more difficult and checking off all optional feature boxes. Now that all features suggested have been implemented, I would take the game above and beyond and allow the buttons to rearrange themselves after a player starts the game randomly. Doing this would make my game unique and one that I have never seen before. I pride myself on being myself and doing this differently from others. Therefore this would allow me to have this game as an outstanding achievement and ensure my coding ability.
